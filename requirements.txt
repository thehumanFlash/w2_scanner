# This project uses pyproject.toml for dependency management
# To install dependencies, use:
#   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
#
# This file is kept for compatibility with tools that expect requirements.txt
# but pyproject.toml is the source of truth for dependencies.
#
# If you need to generate this file from pyproject.toml, run:
#   uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.txt
